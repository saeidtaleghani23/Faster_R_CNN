This repository contains an implementation of Faster R-CNN for object detection, focusing on a custom modification where only the Region of Interest (RoI) head is unfrozen for fine-tuning. The goal is to leverage a pre-trained model while adjusting the classifier to fit a specific number of classes, providing efficient and high-performance detection on a custom dataset.

## Model Overview

Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is a state-of-the-art model for object detection that integrates both region proposal and object classification into a unified network, which significantly improves the speed and accuracy of detection tasks. By utilizing a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to suggest regions of interest, Faster R-CNN minimizes the need for external region proposals, streamlining the detection pipeline.

## Implementation Details

This implementation uses a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for feature extraction. The following adjustments were made:

- **Backbone**: ResNet-50 with FPN, pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
- **Custom Classes**: The modelâ€™s RoI head classifier is modified to fit the desired number of classes.
- **Fine-Tuning**: All layers are frozen except the RoI head, specifically the box predictor, allowing only the classification layers to learn from the custom dataset. This approach leverages pre-trained features while adjusting for new classes with minimal training time.

### Example Output
